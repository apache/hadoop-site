This is the latest (alpha) version in the hadoop-2.x series.

This release delivers significant major features and stability over
previous releases in hadoop-2.x series:

-   QJM for HDFS HA for NameNode
-   Multi-resource scheduling (CPU and memory) for YARN
-   YARN ResourceManager Restart
-   Significant stability at scale for YARN (over 30,000 nodes and 14
million applications so far, at time of release)

This release, like previous releases in hadoop-2.x series is still
considered *alpha* primarily since some of APIs aren't fully-baked and
we expect some churn in future. Furthermore, please note that there are
some API changes from previous hadoop-2.0.2-alpha release and
applications will need to recompile against hadoop-2.0.3-alpha.

Please see the [Hadoop 2.0.3-alpha Release
Notes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.0.3-alpha/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/releasenotes.html)
for details.
