Feature highlights:

SBOM artifacts
----------------------------------------
Starting from this release, Hadoop publishes Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using
CycloneDX Maven plugin. For more information on SBOM, please go to
[SBOM](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/SBOM).

HDFS RBF: RDBMS based token storage support
----------------------------------------
HDFS Router-Router Based Federation now supports storing delegation tokens on MySQL,
[HADOOP-18535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18535)
which improves token operation through over the original Zookeeper-based implementation.

New File System APIs
----------------------------------------
[HADOOP-18671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-18671) moved a number of
HDFS-specific APIs to Hadoop Common to make it possible for certain applications that
depend on HDFS semantics to run on other Hadoop compatible file systems.

In particular, recoverLease() and isFileClosed() are exposed through LeaseRecoverable
interface, while setSafeMode() is exposed through SafeMode interface.
