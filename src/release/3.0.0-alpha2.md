This is the second alpha in a series of planned alphas and betas leading up to a 3.0.0 GA release. The intention is to "release early, release often" to quickly iterate on feedback collected from downstream users.

Please note that alpha releases come with no guarantees of quality or API stability, and are not intended for production use.

Users are encouraged to read the [overview of major changes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0-alpha2/index.html) coming

and [changelog](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0-alpha2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/release/3.0.0-alpha2/CHANGES.3.0.0-alpha2.html) detail 857 fixes, improvements, and new features since the previous 3.0.0-alpha2 release.
