This release contains many improvements, new features, bug fixes and
optimizations.

Notably, this contains the first working version of
[HBase](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase).

See the release notes (above) for details.

When upgrading an existing HDFS filesystem to a 0.15.x release from an
earlier release, you should first start HDFS with 'bin/start-dfs.sh
-upgrade'. See the [Hadoop
Upgrade](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hadoop_Upgrade) page for details.
