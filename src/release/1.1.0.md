This is a beta release for version 1.1.

This release has approximately 135 enhancements and bug fixes compared
to Hadoop-1.0.4, including:

-   Many performance improvements in HDFS, backported from trunk
-   Improvements in Security to use SPNEGO instead of Kerberized SSL for
HTTP transactions
-   Lower default minimum heartbeat for task trackers from 3 sec to
300msec to increase job throughput on small clusters
-   Port of Gridmix v3
-   Set MALLOC\_ARENA\_MAX in hadoop-config.sh to resolve problems with
glibc in RHEL-6
-   Splittable bzip2 files
-   Of course it also has the same security fix as release 1.0.4.

Please see the [Hadoop 1.1.0 Release
Notes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.1.0/releasenotes.html) for
details.
