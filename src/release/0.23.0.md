This is the alpha version of the hadoop-0.23 major release. This is the
first release we've made off Apache Hadoop trunk in a long while. This
release is alpha-quality and not yet ready for serious use.

hadoop-0.23 contains several major advances:

-   HDFS Federation
-   NextGen MapReduce (YARN)

It also has several major performance improvements to both HDFS and
MapReduce.

See the [Hadoop 0.23.0 Release
Notes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.23.0/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/releasenotes.html)
for details.
