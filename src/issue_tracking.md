Hadoop tracks both bugs and enhancement requests using JIRA.

We welcome input, however, **before filing a request,** please make sure
you do the following:

  - Search the Apache JIRA database.
  - Check the users [mailing lists](mailing_lists.html#Users), both by searching the archives and by asking questions.
