## Overview

The Hadoop source code resides in the Apache git repository, and available from here:
https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=hadoop.git

The changes are also mirrored to the github repository https://github.com/apache/hadoop

Hdfs, Yarn, Mapreduce and other components all are parts of this one repository.
