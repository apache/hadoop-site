[Hadoop Wins Terabyte Sort
Benchmark](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/hadoop/2008/07/apache_hadoop_wins_terabyte_sort_benchmark.html):
One of Yahoo's Hadoop clusters sorted 1 terabyte of data in 209 seconds,
which beat the previous record of 297 seconds in the annual general
purpose (Daytona) [terabyte sort benchmark](http://sortbenchmark.org/).
This is the first time that either a Java or an open source program has
won.
