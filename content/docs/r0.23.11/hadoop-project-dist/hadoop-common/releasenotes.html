     Blocker bug reported by Mit Desai and fixed by Mit Desai <br>
     <b>Javascript injection on the job status page</b><br>
     <blockquote>Scripts can be injected into the job status page as the diagnostics field is
not sanitized. Whatever string you set there will show up to the jobs page as it is ... ie. if you put any script commands, they will be executed in the browser of the user who is opening the page.

We need escaping the diagnostic string in order to not run the scripts.</blockquote></li>

     Critical bug reported by Thomas Graves and fixed by Mit Desai <br>
     <b>aggregated log writer can write more log data then it says is the log length</b><br>
     <blockquote>We have seen exceptions when using 'yarn logs' to read log files. 
at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
       at java.lang.Long.parseLong(Long.java:441)
       at java.lang.Long.parseLong(Long.java:483)
       at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.logaggregation.AggregatedLogFormat$LogReader.readAContainerLogsForALogType(AggregatedLogFormat.java:518)
       at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.logaggregation.LogDumper.dumpAContainerLogs(LogDumper.java:178)
       at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.logaggregation.LogDumper.run(LogDumper.java:130)
       at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.logaggregation.LogDumper.main(LogDumper.java:246)


We traced it down to the reader trying to read the file type of the next file but where it reads is still log data from the previous file.  What happened was the Log Length was written as a certain size but the log data was actually longer then that.  

Inside of the write() routine in LogValue it first writes what the logfile length is, but then when it goes to write the log itself it just goes to the end of the file.  There is a race condition here where if someone is still writing to the file when it goes to be aggregated the length written could be to small.

We should have the write() routine stop when it writes whatever it said was the length.  It would be nice if we could somehow tell the user it might be truncated but I'm not sure of a good way to do this.

We also noticed that a bug in readAContainerLogsForALogType where it is using an int for curRead whereas it should be using a long. 

      while (len != -1 &amp;&amp; curRead &lt; fileLength) {

This isn't actually a problem right now as it looks like the underlying decoder is doing the right thing and the len condition exits.</blockquote></li>

     Trivial bug reported by Thomas Graves and fixed by Chen He (capacityscheduler)<br>
     <b>Update capacity scheduler docs to include types on the configs</b><br>
     <blockquote>The capacity scheduler docs (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.1.0-beta/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html) don't include types for all the configs. For instance the minimum-user-limit-percent doesn't say its an Int.  It also the only setting for the Resource Allocation configs that is an Int rather then a float.</blockquote></li>
