<p>This page covers the S3A Committers, which can commit work directly to an S3 object store.</p>
<p>These committers are designed to solve a fundamental problem which the standard committers of work cannot do to S3: consistent, high performance, and reliable commitment of output to S3.</p>
<p>For details on their internal design, see <a href="./committer_architecture.html">S3A Committers: Architecture and Implementation</a>.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Introduction:_The_Commit_Problem"></a>Introduction: The Commit Problem</h2>
<p>Apache Hadoop MapReduce (and behind the scenes, Apache Spark) often write the output of their work to filesystems</p>
<p>Normally, Hadoop uses the <tt>FileOutputFormatCommitter</tt> to manage the promotion of files created in a single task attempt to the final output of a query. This is done in a way to handle failures of tasks and jobs, and to support speculative execution. It does that by listing directories and renaming their content into the final destination when tasks and then jobs are committed.</p>
<p>This has some key requirement of the underlying filesystem:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>When you list a directory, you see all the files which have been created in it, and no files which are not in it (i.e. have been deleted).</li>
<li>When you rename a directory, it is an <tt>O(1)</tt> atomic transaction. No other process across the cluster may rename a file or directory to the same path. If the rename fails for any reason, either the data is at the original location, or it is at the destination, -in which case the rename actually succeeded.</li>
</ol>
<p>*<i>The S3 object store and the <tt>s3a://</tt> filesystem client cannot meet these requirements.</i></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>Amazon S3 has inconsistent directory listings unless S3Guard is enabled.</li>
<li>The S3A mimics <tt>rename()</tt> by copying files and then deleting the originals. This can fail partway through, and there is nothing to prevent any other process in the cluster attempting a rename at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result,</p>
<ul>

<li>Files my not be listed, hence not renamed into place.</li>
<li>Deleted files may still be discovered, confusing the rename process to the point of failure.</li>
<li>If a rename fails, the data is left in an unknown state.</li>
<li>If more than one process attempts to commit work simultaneously, the output directory may contain the results of both processes: it is no longer an exclusive operation. *. While S3Guard may deliver the listing consistency, commit time is still proportional to the amount of data created. It still can&#x2019;t handle task failure.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Using the &#x201c;classic&#x201d; <tt>FileOutputCommmitter</tt> to commit work to Amazon S3 risks loss or corruption of generated data</b></p>
<p>To address these problems there is now explicit support in the <tt>hadop-aws</tt> module for committing work to Amazon S3 via the S3A filesystem client, <i>the S3A Committers</i></p>
<p>For safe, as well as high-performance output of work to S3, we need use &#x201c;a committer&#x201d; explicitly written to work with S3, treating it as an object store with special features.</p>

<h3><a name="Background_:_Hadoop.E2.80.99s_.E2.80.9CCommit_Protocol.E2.80.9D"></a>Background : Hadoop&#x2019;s &#x201c;Commit Protocol&#x201d;</h3>
<p>How exactly is work written to its final destination? That is accomplished by a &#x201c;commit protocol&#x201d; between the workers and the job manager.</p>
<p>This protocol is implemented in Hadoop MapReduce, with a similar but extended version in Apache Spark:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>A &#x201c;Job&#x201d; is the entire query, with inputs to outputs</li>
<li>The &#x201c;Job Manager&#x201d; is the process in charge of choreographing the execution of the job. It may perform some of the actual computation too.</li>
<li>The job has &#x201c;workers&#x201d;, which are processes which work the actual data and write the results.</li>
<li>Workers execute &#x201c;Tasks&#x201d;, which are fractions of the job, a job whose input has been <i>partitioned</i> into units of work which can be executed independently.</li>
<li>The Job Manager directs workers to execute &#x201c;tasks&#x201d;, usually trying to schedule the work close to the data (if the filesystem provides locality information).</li>
<li>Workers can fail: the Job manager needs to detect this and reschedule their active tasks.</li>
<li>Workers can also become separated from the Job Manager, a &#x201c;network partition&#x201d;. It is (provably) impossible for the Job Manager to distinguish a running-but-unreachable worker from a failed one.</li>
<li>The output of a failed task must not be visible; this is to avoid its data getting into the final output.</li>
<li>Multiple workers can be instructed to evaluate the same partition of the work; this &#x201c;speculation&#x201d; delivers speedup as it can address the &#x201c;straggler problem&#x201d;. When multiple workers are working on the same data, only one worker is allowed to write the final output.</li>
<li>The entire job may fail (often from the failure of the Job Manager (MR Master, Spark Driver, &#x2026;)). 1, The network may partition, with workers isolated from each other or the process managing the entire commit.</li>
<li>Restarted jobs may recover from a failure by reusing the output of all completed tasks (MapReduce with the &#x201c;v1&#x201d; algorithm), or just by rerunning everything (The &#x201c;v2&#x201d; algorithm and Spark).</li>
</ol>
<p>What is &#x201c;the commit protocol&#x201d; then? It is the requirements on workers as to when their data is made visible, where, for a filesystem, &#x201c;visible&#x201d; means &#x201c;can be seen in the destination directory of the query.&#x201d;</p>
<ul>

<li>There is a destination directory of work, &#x201c;the output directory.&#x201d;</li>
<li>The final output of tasks must be in this directory <i>or paths underneath it</i>.</li>
<li>The intermediate output of a task must not be visible in the destination directory. That is: they must not write directly to the destination.</li>
<li>The final output of a task <i>may</i> be visible under the destination.</li>
<li>The Job Manager makes the decision as to whether a task&#x2019;s data is to be &#x201c;committed&#x201d;, be it directly to the final directory or to some intermediate store..</li>
<li>Individual workers communicate with the Job manager to manage the commit process: whether the output is to be <i>committed</i> or <i>aborted</i></li>
<li>When a worker commits the output of a task, it somehow promotes its intermediate work to becoming final.</li>
<li>When a worker aborts a task&#x2019;s output, that output must not become visible (i.e. it is not committed).</li>
<li>Jobs themselves may be committed/aborted (the nature of &#x201c;when&#x201d; is not covered here).</li>
<li>After a Job is committed, all its work must be visible.</li>
<li>And a file <tt>_SUCCESS</tt> may be written to the output directory.</li>
<li>After a Job is aborted, all its intermediate data is lost.</li>
<li>Jobs may also fail. When restarted, the successor job must be able to clean up all the intermediate and committed work of its predecessor(s).</li>
<li>Task and Job processes measure the intervals between communications with their Application Master and YARN respectively. When the interval has grown too large they must conclude that the network has partitioned and that they must abort their work.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#x2019;s &#x201c;essentially&#x201d; it. When working with HDFS and similar filesystems, directory <tt>rename()</tt> is the mechanism used to commit the work of tasks and jobs. * Tasks write data to task attempt directories under the directory <tt>_temporary</tt> underneath the final destination directory. * When a task is committed, these files are renamed to the destination directory (v2 algorithm) or a job attempt directory under <tt>_temporary</tt> (v1 algorithm). * When a job is committed, for the v2 algorithm the <tt>_SUCCESS</tt> file is created, and the <tt>_temporary</tt> deleted. * For the v1 algorithm, when a job is committed, all the tasks committed under the job attempt directory will have their output renamed into the destination directory. * The v2 algorithm recovers from failure by deleting the destination directory and restarting the job. * The v1 algorithm recovers from failure by discovering all committed tasks whose output is in the job attempt directory, <i>and only rerunning all uncommitted tasks</i>.</p>
<p>None of this algorithm works safely or swiftly when working with &#x201c;raw&#x201d; AWS S3 storage: * Directory listing can be inconsistent: the tasks and jobs may not list all work to be committed. * Renames go from being fast, atomic operations to slow operations which can fail partway through.</p>
<p>This then is the problem which the S3A committers address:</p>
<p><i>How to safely and reliably commit work to Amazon S3 or compatible object store</i></p></div></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Meet_the_S3A_Commmitters"></a>Meet the S3A Commmitters</h2>
<p>Since Hadoop 3.1, the S3A FileSystem has been accompanied by classes designed to integrate with the Hadoop and Spark job commit protocols, classes which interact with the S3A filesystem to reliably commit work work to S3: <i>The S3A Committers</i></p>
<p>The underlying architecture of this process is very complex, and covered in <a href="./committer_architecture.html">the committer architecture documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The key concept to know of is S3&#x2019;s &#x201c;Multipart Upload&#x201d; mechanism. This allows an S3 client to write data to S3 in multiple HTTP POST requests, only completing the write operation with a final POST to complete the upload; this final POST consisting of a short list of the etags of the uploaded blocks. This multipart upload mechanism is already automatically used when writing large amounts of data to S3; an implementation detail of the S3A output stream.</p>
<p>The S3A committers make explicit use of this multipart upload (&#x201c;MPU&#x201d;) mechanism:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The individual <i>tasks</i> in a job write their data to S3 as POST operations within multipart uploads, yet do not issue the final POST to complete the upload.</li>
<li>The multipart uploads are committed in the job commit process.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two different S3A committer types, <i>staging</i> and <i>magic</i>. The committers primarily vary in how data is written during task execution, how  the pending commit information is passed to the job manager, and in how conflict with existing files is resolved.</p>

<p>The other metric is &#x201c;maturity&#x201d;. There, the fact that the Staging committers are based on Netflix&#x2019;s production code counts in its favor.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="The_Staging_Committer"></a>The Staging Committer</h3>
<p>This is based on work from Netflix. It &#x201c;stages&#x201d; data into the local filesystem. It also requires the cluster to have HDFS, so that</p>
<p>Tasks write to URLs with <tt>file://</tt> schemas. When a task is committed, its files are listed, uploaded to S3 as incompleted Multipart Uploads. The information needed to complete the uploads is saved to HDFS where it is committed through the standard &#x201c;v1&#x201d; commit algorithm.</p>
<p>When the Job is committed, the Job Manager reads the lists of pending writes from its HDFS Job destination directory and completes those uploads.</p>
<p>Cancelling a task is straighforward: the local directory is deleted with its staged data. Cancelling a job is achieved by reading in the lists of pending writes from the HDFS job attempt directory, and aborting those uploads. For extra safety, all outstanding multipart writes to the destination directory are aborted.</p>
<p>The staging committer comes in two slightly different forms, with slightly diffrent conflict resolution policies:</p>
<ul>

<li>

<p><b>Directory</b>: the entire directory tree of data is written or overwritten, as normal.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><b>Partitioned</b>: special handling of partitioned directory trees of the form <tt>YEAR=2017/MONTH=09/DAY=19</tt>: conflict resolution is limited to the partitions being updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Partitioned Committer is intended to allow jobs updating a partitioned directory tree to restrict the conflict resolution to only those partition directories containing new data. It is intended for use with Apache Spark only.</p></div></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Conflict_Resolution_in_the_Staging_Committers"></a>Conflict Resolution in the Staging Committers</h2>
<p>The Staging committers offer the ability to replace the conflict policy of the execution engine with policy designed to work with the tree of data. This is based on the experience and needs of Netflix, where efficiently adding new data to an existing partitioned directory tree is a common operation.</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre class="source">&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;fs.s3a.committer.staging.conflict-mode&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;fail&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
    Staging committer conflict resolution policy: {@value}.
    Supported: fail, append, replace.
  &lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</pre></div></div>

<p><b>replace</b> : when the job is committed (and not before), delete files in directories into which new data will be written.</p>
<p><b>fail</b>: when there are existing files in the destination, fail the job.</p>
<p><b>append</b>: Add new data to the directories at the destination; overwriting any with the same name. Reliable use requires unique names for generated files, which the committers generate by default.</p>
<p>The difference between the two staging ommitters are as follows:</p>
<p>The Directory Committer uses the entire directory tree for conflict resolution. If any file exists at the destination it will fail in job setup; if the resolution mechanism is &#x201c;replace&#x201d; then all existing files will be deleted.</p>
<p>The partitioned committer calculates the partitions into which files are added, the final directories in the tree, and uses that in its conflict resolution process:</p>
<p><b>replace</b> : delete all data in the destination partition before committing the new files.</p>
<p><b>fail</b>: fail if there is data in the destination partition, ignoring the state of any parallel partitions.</p>
<p><b>append</b>: add the new data.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s intended for use in Apache Spark Dataset operations, rather than Hadoop&#x2019;s original MapReduce engine, and only in jobs where adding new data to an existing dataset is the desired goal.</p>
<p>Preequisites for successful work</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The output is written into partitions via <tt>PARTITIONED BY</tt> or <tt>partitionedBy()</tt> instructions.</li>
<li>There is no data written directly to the root path (all files there are ignored; it&#x2019;s implicitly &#x201c;append&#x201d;).</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#x2019;s an example in Spark, assuming that <tt>sourceDataset</tt> is a dataset whose columns include &#x201c;year&#x201d; and &#x201c;month&#x201d;:</p>

  .save(&quot;s3a://examples/statistics&quot;)
</pre></div></div>

<div class="section">
<h3><a name="The_Magic_Committer"></a>The Magic Committer</h3>
<p>The &#x201c;Magic&#x201d; committer does its work through &#x201c;magic&#x201d; in the filesystem: attempts to write to specific &#x201c;magic&#x201d; paths are interpreted as writes to a parent directory <i>which are not to be completed</i>. When the output stream is closed, the information needed to complete the write is saved in the magic directory. The task committer saves the list of these to a directory for the job committers use, or, if aborting, lists the pending writes and aborts them.</p>
<p>The job committer reads in the list of pending commits, and commits them as the Staging Committer does.</p>
<p>Compared to the Staging Committer, the Magic Committer offers faster write times: output is uploaded to S3 as it is written, rather than in the task commit.</p>
<p>However, it has extra requirements of the filesystem</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>It requires a consistent object store, which for Amazon S3, means that <a href="./s3guard.html">S3Guard</a> must be enabled. For third-party stores, consult the documentation.</li>
<li>The S3A client must be configured to recognize interactions with the magic directories and treat them specially.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#x2019;s also not been field tested to the extent of Netflix&#x2019;s committer; consider it the least mature of the committers.</p>

    entries. Otherwise there is a risk that uncommitted uploads may run up
    bills.

<p><i>IMPORTANT</i>: only enable the magic committer against object stores which offer consistent listings. By default, Amazon S3 does not do this -which is why the option <tt>fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled</tt> is disabled by default.</p>
<p>Tip: you can verify that a bucket supports the magic committer through the <tt>hadoop s3guard bucket-info</tt> command:</p>

<div>

<pre class="source">&gt; hadoop s3guard bucket-info -magic s3a://landsat-pds/

<h2><a name="Error_message:_.22File_being_created_has_a_magic_path.2C_but_the_filesystem_has_magic_file_support_disabled:"></a>Error message: &quot;File being created has a magic path, but the filesystem has magic file support disabled:</h2>
<p>A file is being written to a path which is used for &#x201c;magic&#x201d; files, files which are actually written to a different destination than their stated path <i>but the filesystem doesn&#x2019;t support &#x201c;magic&#x201d; files</i></p>
<p>This message should not appear through the committer itself &#x2014;it will fail with the error message in the previous section, but may arise if other applications are attempting to create files under the path <tt>/__magic/</tt>.</p>
<p>Make sure the filesytem meets the requirements of the magic committer (a consistent S3A filesystem through S3Guard or the S3 service itself), and set the <tt>fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled</tt> flag to indicate that magic file writes are supported.</p>

<h3><a name="FileOutputCommitter_appears_to_be_still_used_.28from_logs_or_delays_in_commits.29"></a><tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> appears to be still used (from logs or delays in commits)</h3>
<p>The Staging committers use the original <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> to manage the propagation of commit information: do not worry if it the logs show <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> work with data in the cluster filesystem (e.g. HDFS).</p>
<p>One way to make sure that the <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> is not being used to write the data to S3 is to set the option <tt>mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version</tt> to a value such as &#x201c;10&#x201d;. Because the only supported algorithms are &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;2&#x201d;, any erroneously created <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> will raise an exception in its constructor when instantiated:</p>

<p>While that will not make the problem go away, it will at least make the failure happen at the start of a job.</p>
<p>(Setting this option will not interfer with the Staging Committers&#x2019; use of HDFS, as it explicitly sets the algorithm to &#x201c;2&#x201d; for that part of its work).</p>
<p>The other way to check which committer to use is to examine the <tt>_SUCCESS</tt> file. If it is 0-bytes long, the classic <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> committed the job. The S3A committers all write a non-empty JSON file; the <tt>committer</tt> field lists the committer used.</p>
<p><i>Common causes</i></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The property <tt>fs.s3a.committer.name</tt> is set to &#x201c;file&#x201d;. Fix: change.</li>
<li>The job has overridden the property <tt>mapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.class</tt> with a new factory class for all committers. This takes priority over all committers registered for the <a class="externalLink" href="s3a://">s3a://</a> schema.</li>
<li>The property <tt>mapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.scheme.s3a</tt> is unset.</li>
<li>The output format has overridden <tt>FileOutputFormat.getOutputCommitter()</tt> and is returning its own committer -one which is a subclass of <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That final cause. <i>the output format is returning its own committer</i>, is not easily fixed; it may be that the custom committer performs critical work during its lifecycle, and contains assumptions about the state of the written data during task and job commit (i.e. it is in the destination filesystem). Consult with the authors/maintainers of the output format to see whether it would be possible to integrate with the new committer factory mechanism and object-store-specific commit algorithms.</p>
<p>Parquet is a special case here: its committer does no extra work other than add the option to read all newly-created files then write a schema summary. The Spark integration has explicit handling for Parquet to enable it to support the new committers, removing this (slow on S3) option.</p>
<p>If you have subclassed <tt>FileOutputCommitter</tt> and want to move to the factory model, please get in touch.</p></div></div>

<p>This surfaces when either of two conditions are met.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>The Directory committer is used with <tt>fs.s3a.committer.staging.conflict-mode</tt> set to <tt>fail</tt> and the output/destination directory exists. The job will fail in the driver during job setup.</li>
<li>The Partitioned Committer is used with <tt>fs.s3a.committer.staging.conflict-mode</tt> set to <tt>fail</tt>  and one of the partitions. The specific task(s) generating conflicting data will fail during task commit, which will cause the entire job to fail.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are trying to write data and want write conflicts to be rejected, this is the correct behavior: there was data at the destination so the job was aborted.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a name="Staging_committer_task_fails_with_IOException:_No_space_left_on_device"></a>Staging committer task fails with IOException: No space left on device</h2>
<p>There&#x2019;s not enough space on the local hard disk (real or virtual) to store all the uncommitted data of the active tasks on that host. Because the staging committers write all output to the local disk and only upload the data on task commits, enough local temporary storage is needed to store all output generated by all uncommitted tasks running on the single host. Small EC2 VMs may run out of disk.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<li>

<p>Make sure that <tt>fs.s3a.buffer.dir</tt> includes a temporary directory on every available hard disk; this spreads load better.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Add more disk space. In EC2: request instances with more local storage. There is no need for EMR storage; this is just for temporary data.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Purge the directories listed in <tt>fs.s3a.buffer.dir</tt> of old data. Failed tasks may not clean up all old files.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Reduce the number of worker threads/process in the host.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Consider partitioning the job into more tasks. This <i>may</i> result in more tasks generating less data each.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Use the magic committer. This only needs enough disk storage to buffer blocks of the currently being written file during their upload process, so can use a lot less disk space.</p>
</li>
