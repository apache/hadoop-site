<h1>Apache Hadoop Project Bylaws</h1> 

    
<a name="N1000D"></a><a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Introduction</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Hadoop project
    operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project,
    who may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.</p>
<p>Hadoop is a project of the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software
    Foundation</a>.  The foundation holds the trademark on the name
    "Hadoop" and copyright on Apache code
    including the code in the Hadoop codebase. The <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">foundation FAQ</a>
    explains the operation and background of the foundation.</p>
<p>Hadoop is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under a set
    of principles, known collectively as the "Apache Way". If
    you are new to Apache development, please refer to the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Incubator project</a> for more
    information on how Apache projects operate.</p>
</div>

   
<a name="N10028"></a><a name="Roles+and+Responsibilities"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Apache projects define a set of roles with associated rights and
   responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may
   perform within the project. The roles are defined in the following
   sections</p>
<ul>
   
<li> 
<strong>Users</strong>

        
<p>The most important participants in the project are people who
        use our software. The majority of our developers start out as
        users and guide their development efforts from the user's
        perspective.</p>

        
<p> Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing feedback
        to developers in the form of bug reports and feature
        suggestions. As well, users participate in the Apache
        community by helping other users on mailing lists and user
        support forums.</p>
</li>

   
<li> 
<strong>Contributors</strong>

        
<p>All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code,
        documentation, or resources to the Hadoop Project. A contributor
        that makes sustained, welcome contributions to the project may
        be invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of
        such invitations depends on many factors.</p>
</li>

   
<li> 
<strong>Committers</strong>

        
<p>The project's Committers are responsible for the project's
        technical management. Committers have access to all subproject
        subversion repositories. Committers may cast binding votes on
        any technical discussion regarding any subproject.</p>

        
<p>Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved by
        consensus approval of the active PMC members. A Committer is
        considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not
        contributing in any form to the project for over six
        months. An emeritus committer may request reinstatement of
        commit access from the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
        consensus approval of active PMC members.</p>

        
<p>Significant, pervasive features are often developed in a speculative
        branch of the repository. The PMC may grant commit rights on the
        branch to its consistent contributors, while the initiative is active.
        Branch committers are responsible for shepherding their feature into
        an active release and do not cast binding votes or vetoes in the
        project.</p>

        
<p>All Apache committers are required to have a signed Contributor
        License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache Software
        Foundation. There is a <a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">Committer
        FAQ</a> which provides more details on the requirements for
        Committers</p>

        
<p>A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project
        may be invited to become a member of the PMC. The form of
        contribution is not limited to code. It can also include code
        review, helping out users on the mailing lists, documentation,
        testing, etc.</p>
</li>

   
<li> 
<strong>Release Manager</strong>

        
<p>A Release Manager (RM) is a committer who volunteers to produce 
	a Release Candidate according to <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease">HowToRelease</a>.
	The RM shall publish a Release Plan on the <em>common-dev@</em> 
	list stating the branch from which they intend to make a Release 
	Candidate, at least one week before they do so. The RM is responsible 
	for building consensus around the content of the Release Candidate, 
	in order to achieve a successful Product Release vote.</p>
</li>

   
<li> 
<strong>Project Management Committee</strong>

        
<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Hadoop was
        created by the Apache Board in January 2008 when Hadoop moved
        out of Lucene and became a top level project at Apache. The
        PMC is responsible to the board and the ASF for the management
        and oversight of the Apache Hadoop codebase. The
        responsibilities of the PMC include</p>

        
<ul>
        
<li> Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Hadoop
        project.  In particular all releases must be approved by the
        PMC</li>

        
<li> Maintaining the project's shared resources, including the codebase
             repository, mailing lists, websites.</li>

        
<li> Speaking on behalf of the project.</li>

        
<li> Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project</li>

        
<li> Nominating new PMC members and committers</li>

        
<li> Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project</li>
        
</ul>

        
<p>Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be
        approved by a consensus approval of active PMC members. A PMC
        member is considered "emeritus" by their own
        declaration or by not contributing in any form to the project
        for over six months. An emeritus member may request
        reinstatement to the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
        consensus approval of the active PMC members.</p>

        
<p>The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair
        is an office holder of the Apache Software Foundation (Vice
        President, Apache Hadoop) and has primary responsibility to
        the board for the management of the projects within the scope
        of the Hadoop PMC. The chair reports to the board quarterly on
        developments within the Hadoop project.</p>

	
<p>The chair of the PMC is rotated annually. When the chair is
	rotated or if the current chair of the PMC resigns, the PMC
	votes to recommend a new chair using Single Transferable Vote
	(STV) voting. See https://wiki.apache.org/general/BoardVoting
	for specifics. The decision must be ratified by the Apache
	board.</p>
</li>
   
</ul>
</div>


<a name="N10094"></a><a name="Decision+Making"></a>
<h2 class="h3">Decision Making</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Within the Hadoop project, different types of decisions require
      different forms of approval. For example, the 
      <a href="#Roles+and+Responsibilities">previous section</a> 
      describes several
      decisions which require "consensus approval"
      approval. This section defines how voting is performed, the
      types of approvals, and which types of decision require which
      type of approval.</p>
<ul>
      
<li> 
<strong>Voting</strong>

      
<p>Decisions regarding the project are made by votes on the
      primary project development mailing list
      (general@hadoop.apache.org).  Where necessary, PMC voting may
      take place on the private Hadoop PMC mailing list.  Votes are
      clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE].  Votes
      may contain multiple items for approval and these should be
      clearly separated. Voting is carried out by replying to the
      vote mail. Voting may take four flavors</p>

        
<ul>
         
<li> 
<strong>+1</strong> "Yes," "Agree," or 
              "the action 
              should be performed." In general, this vote also indicates 
              a willingness on the behalf of the voter in "making it 
             happen"</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>+0</strong> This vote indicates a willingness for the 
              action under
              consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be able
              to help.</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>-0</strong> This vote indicates that the voter does 
              not, in general, 
              agree with the proposed action but is not concerned enough to 
              prevent the action going ahead.</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>-1</strong> This is a negative vote. On issues where 
              consensus is 
              required, this vote counts as a <strong>veto</strong>. All 
              vetoes must contain an explanation of why the veto is 
              appropriate. Vetoes with no explanation are void. It may also 
              be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an alternative course 
              of action.</li>
        
</ul>

        
<p>All participants in the Hadoop project are encouraged to show their
        agreement with or against a particular action by voting. For technical
        decisions, only the votes of active committers are binding. Non binding
        votes are still useful for those with binding votes to understand the
        perception of an action in the wider Hadoop community. For PMC 
        decisions, only the votes of PMC members are binding.</p>

       
<p>Voting can also be applied to changes made to the Hadoop codebase. 
       These typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit 
       message sent when the commit is made.</p>
</li>

    
<li> 
<strong>Approvals</strong>

        
<p>These are the types of approvals that can be sought. Different 
        actions require different types of approvals</p>

        
<ul>
        
<li> 
<strong>Consensus Approval -</strong>
             Consensus approval requires 3 binding +1 votes
             and no binding vetoes.</li>

        
<li> 
<strong>Lazy Consensus -</strong>
             Lazy consensus requires no -1 votes ('silence gives assent').</li>

        
<li> 
<strong>Lazy Majority - </strong>
             A lazy majority vote requires 3 binding +1
             votes and more binding +1 votes than -1 votes.</li>

        
<li> 
<strong>Lazy 2/3 Majority -</strong>
             Lazy 2/3 majority votes requires at
             least 3 votes and twice as many +1 votes as -1 votes.</li>
        
</ul>
</li>

    
<li> 
<strong>Vetoes</strong>

        
<p>A valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is cast,
        it must be accompanied by a valid reason explaining the
        reasons for the veto. The validity of a veto, if challenged,
        can be confirmed by anyone who has a binding vote. This does
        not necessarily signify agreement with the veto - merely that
        the veto is valid.</p>

        
<p>If you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the person casting
        the veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is not withdrawn, any action
        that has been vetoed must be reversed in a timely manner.</p>
</li>

    
<li> 
<strong>Actions</strong>

        
<p>This section describes the various actions which are undertaken 
        within the project, the corresponding approval required for that 
        action and those who have binding votes over the action.</p>

         
<ul>
         
<li> 
<strong>Code Change</strong>

            
<p>A change made to a codebase of the project and committed
            by a committer. This includes source code, documentation, website
            content, etc.</p>

            
<p>Consensus approval of active committers, but with a minimum of
            one +1. The code can be committed after the first +1, unless
            the code change represents a merge from a branch, in which case
            three +1s are required.</p>
</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>Product Release</strong>

            
<p>When a release of one of the project's products is ready, a 
            vote is required to accept the release as an official release of
            the project.</p>

           
<p>Lazy Majority of active PMC members</p>
</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>Adoption of New Codebase</strong>

            
<p>When the codebase for an existing, released product is to be
            replaced with an alternative codebase. If such a vote fails to
            gain approval, the existing code base will continue.</p>

            
<p>This also covers the creation of new sub-projects
            within the project</p>

            
<p>Lazy 2/3 majority of PMC members</p>
</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>New Branch Committer</strong>

            
<p>When a branch committer is proposed for the PMC</p>

            
<p>Lazy consensus of active PMC members</p>
</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>New Committer</strong>

            
<p>When a new committer is proposed for the project</p>

            
<p>Consensus approval of active PMC members</p>
</li>

         
<li> 
<strong>New PMC Member</strong>

            
<p>When a committer is proposed for the PMC</p>

            
<p>Consensus approval of active PMC members</p>
</li>

         
<li>
