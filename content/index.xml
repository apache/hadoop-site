      <description>New features in release 0.14 include:
 Better checksums in HDFS. Checksums are no longer stored in parallel HDFS files, but are stored directly by datanodes alongside blocks. This is more efficient for the namenode and also improves data integrity. Pipes: A C++ API for MapReduce Eclipse Plugin, including HDFS browsing, job monitoring, etc. File modification times in HDFS.  There are many other improvements, bug fixes, optimizations and new features.</description>

      <title>Apache Hadoop Release Versioning</title>
      <link>https://hadoop.apache.org/versioning.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hadoop.apache.org/versioning.html</guid>
      <description>Background Apache Hadoop uses a version format of &amp;lt;major&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;minor&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;maintenance&amp;gt;, where each version component is a numeric value. Versions can also have additional suffixes like &amp;rdquo;-alpha2&amp;rdquo; or &amp;rdquo;-beta1&amp;rdquo;, which denote the API compatibility guarantees and quality of the release. We use &amp;ldquo;a.b.c&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;x.y.z&amp;rdquo; to denote a dotted version triplet.
Major versions are used to introduce substantial, potentially incompatible, changes. Examples of this include the replacement of MapReduce 1 with YARN and MapReduce 2 in Hadoop 2, and the required Java runtime version from JDK7 to JDK8 in Hadoop 3.</description>

      <title>Criteria for Committership</title>

      <description>Committers are responsible for reviewing and integrating code changes. The PMC votes to make a contributor a committer based on an assessment of their contributions to the project. Contributions can be made in many ways, and there is no one route to committership. That said, here are the general criteria that the PMC looks for from all potential committers:
 A history of sustained contribution to the project. This is a way for a contributor to demonstrate their expertise in an area, and thus their ability to help review and commit contributions by others in that same area.</description>

      <description>Apache Hadoop
The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.</description>

      <description>Apache Hadoop Project Members We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support. We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and we do not necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an individual basis. Instead, we have setup mailing lists for each module which often contain hundreds of individuals who will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit of using mailing lists over private communication is that it is a shared resource where others can also learn from common mistakes and as a community we all grow together.</description>
