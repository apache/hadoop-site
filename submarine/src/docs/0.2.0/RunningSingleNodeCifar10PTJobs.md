# Tutorial: Running a standalone Cifar10 PyTorch Estimator Example.

Currently, PyTorch integration with Submarine only supports PyTorch in standalone (non-distributed mode).
Please also note that HDFS as a data source is not yet supported by PyTorch.

## What is CIFAR-10?
CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition. Below example is based on CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Warning:**

Please note that YARN service doesn't allow multiple services with the same name, so please run following command
```
yarn application -destroy <service-name>
```
to delete services if you want to reuse the same service name.

## Prepare Docker images

Refer to [Write Dockerfile](docs/0.2.0/WriteDockerfilePT) to build a Docker image or use prebuilt one.

## Running PyTorch jobs

### Run standalone training

```shell
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH="/home/systest/hadoop-submarine-score-yarnservice-runtime-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:/home/systest/hadoop-submarine-core-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
/opt/hadoop/bin/yarn jar /home/systest/hadoop-submarine-core-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar job run \
--name pytorch-job-001 \
--verbose \
--framework pytorch \
--wait_job_finish \
--docker_image pytorch-latest-gpu:0.0.1 \
--input_path hdfs://unused \
--env DOCKER_JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre \
--env DOCKER_HADOOP_HDFS_HOME=/hadoop-3.1.2 \
--env YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_DELAYED_REMOVAL=true \
--num_workers 1 \
--worker_resources memory=5G,vcores=2 \
--worker_launch_cmd "cd /test/ && python cifar10_tutorial.py"
```

For the meaning of the individual parameters, see the [QuickStart](docs/0.2.0/QuickStart) page!

**Remarks:**
Please note that the input path parameter is mandatory, but not yet used by the PyTorch docker container.
