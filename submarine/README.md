# Apache Hadoop Submarine web page

This is the source code of the website of Apache Hadoop Submarine.

To render it you need hugo static site generator (https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) which is available for the most popular platforms as a single binary.

To render the final website use the following command:

```
hugo -d /destination/dir
```

To develop the site use

```
hugo serve
```

which starts an internal server where you can always check the final rendered version.
