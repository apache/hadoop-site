            <p class="lead">
                Submarine is a new subproject of Apache Hadoop.</p>
            <p class="lead">Submarine is a project which allows infra engineer / data scientist
            to run deep learning applications (Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc.) on resource management platform (like YARN).

                <p>
                 The submarine program supports YARN and Kubernetes as resource scheduling frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Containers and dockers are supported as containers for machine learning algorithms in YARN.
