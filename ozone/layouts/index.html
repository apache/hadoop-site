                Ozone is a scalable, redundant, and distributed object store for Hadoop. Apart from scaling to billions of objects of varying sizes, Ozone can function effectively in containerized environments such as Kubernetes and YARN. </p> <p>Applications using frameworks like Apache Spark, YARN and Hive work natively without any modifications.</p>
            <p class="lead">Ozone is built on a highly available, replicated block storage layer called Hadoop Distributed Data Store (HDDS).

                 Ozone is designed to scale to tens of billions of files and
                 blocks and, in the future, even more.
